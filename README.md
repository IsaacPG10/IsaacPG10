- 👋 Hi, I’m Isaac
- 👀 I’m interested in building my skills as a software engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and havin' a crack at C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any mobile applications or websites.
- 📫 How to reach me: isaac.evb1@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Made the deans list, and was selected to join a national honors society after switching my major to Computer Science. However despite these university recognized accolades,
  I started out as a graphic design major who's first class was an introduction to programming in C++, which i failed woefully. On that day, I believed I'll never write a single line of
  code again. Now, I make sure to improve and hone my coding skills every single day with aspirations to develop a retail revolutionizing software application!
   Who would've thought? Not me
